# Optimizing-Database-Query-Performance-Using-Table-Partitioning-Techniques

Database performance is a primary branch of information technology which deals with the proper management of the database. The primary goal of the data management is to provide the organizations daily routines with powerful applications that have to be run efficiently. Performance optimization has a critical role in improving the database usage. In particular, managing the massive amount of data generated daily by various users. The main target of this research is to evaluate the data partitioning technique in enhancing the performance of quires submitted to large databases. The encouraging results show that data partitioning could improve the performance of DBMS which manages massive databases. The experiments reveal that data partitioning has a remarkable impact on the query execution time in big databases, which exceeds 35% compared to small database size or not partitioned database.
